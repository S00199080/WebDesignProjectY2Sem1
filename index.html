      <p><h1 class="PageHead1">General History of the Premier League</h1>
      <p class="History1">The background of the Premier League was a bleak period for English club football. The attendances were record low and the league were notorious for hooligans. In the 1985-86, the league started without a TV coverage since the parts couldn't agree upon a deal. At this time, the biggest clubs in the country began discussions about launching a new independent league.

The establishment of the Premier League meant a historical divide of the top-level division from the Football League. The new league would not be part of the Football League, with traditions going back to the 1880s. Yet, it would continue to be a part of the league system â€“ the worst placed teams in the Premier League would be relegated to the second level and the best placed teams would vice versa be promoted from the second level to Premier League.</p></p>

      <h2>Previous Premier League Season Outcome</h2>
      <h4 class="PremOutcome"> The previous Premier League season(2019-2020) was one comfortably by Liverpool F.C. After a shaky start to the season by all other usual contenders for the title Liverpool were able to gain a substantial lead before Christmas, following this the league took a break due to Covid which was unheard of for something like this. In the end when the Premier League came back, Liverpools form had not dropped and they continued to beat most teams that they encountered until a shock 3 nil loss to Watford. however by that point it did not matter, Liverpool had comfortably won with Manchester City coming in second, Manchester United coming in third and chelsea coming in fourth.</h4>

      <h2>Premier League Rules/Info</h2>
      <h4 class="PremInfo">The league takes place between August and May and involves the teams playing each other home and away across the season, a total of 380 matches. Three points are awarded for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat, with the team with the most points at the end of the season winning the Premier League title. The teams that finish in the bottom three of the league table at the end of the campaign are relegated to the Championship, the second tier of English football. Those teams are replaced by three clubs promoted from the Championship; the sides that finish in first and second place and the third via the end-of-season playoffs. If any clubs finish with the same number of points, their position in the Premier League table is determined by goal difference, then the number of goals scored. If the teams still cannot be separated, they will be awarded the same position in the table. Since the League began in 1992, there have been seven different winners: Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City and Liverpool. Man Utd have had the most success with 13 titles in the 28 seasons so far.  </h4>
